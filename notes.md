Hook:

Educational progamming games do not give a practical context for getting
comfortable with real-world programming tasks. Intermediate programmers need a
context where they encounter runtime errors and witness behavioral bugs in real
time with real languages.

What programmers need:

- A capable environment for text editing and interacting with the console
- Basic implementation examples to reference for solving similar problems
- Simple challenges that reflect on real-world business-friendly features

I am aiming to build games that incorporate these elements in a context that
attracts recreational programmers to improve their skills and join the
community.

- BF Joust: https://esolangs.org/wiki/BF_Joust
- FORTH Salon: https://forthsalon.appspot.com/
- Elevator Saga: https://play.elevatorsaga.com/
- Fight Code Game: http://beta.fightcodegame.com/
